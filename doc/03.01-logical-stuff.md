03.01 | How to Implement (Logical Stuff)
========================================

The most fun part of our challenge is getting the calculator to work.
But, how can I do this?

First things first, I need to print a fancy UI, such as:

```txt
Calculator
==========

> < SOME MATH EXPR >
```

By pressing `Enter`, we want to get the math expression result, for
example:

```txt
Calculator
==========

> 5 + 2 + 1

< ENTER BEING PRESSED >

---

Calculator
==========

> 8 (because 5 + 2 + 1 eq 8)
```

But, how can I evaluate `5 + 2 + 1` expr to his final result? ðŸ¤”

Evaluating
----------

To evaluate expr to the final result, we can split our prompt into
tiny sections and tokenize each element, for example:

```txt
5 + 2 + 1 :=
  (5) -> int number
  (+) -> plus symbol
  (2) -> int number
  (+) -> plus symbol
  (1) -> int number

so...

5  +  2  +  1
â”‚  â”‚  â”‚  â”‚  â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”˜  â”‚  â”‚
   â””â”€ 7  +  1
      â””â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”˜
         â””â”€â”€â”€ 8
```

It's simple, right? But theres is a bunch os math constraints, such
as:
- ever read from left to right;
- `*` and `/` opers have higher priority than `+` and `-` opers;
- the most deep `()` expr have the highest priority in the entire
  prompt;
- division by 0 will always return an error. How can I implement
  error detection at eval time?;
- Many others (I'll talk about them in the next page `03.02`).
