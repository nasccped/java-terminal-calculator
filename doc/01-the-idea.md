01 | The Idea
=============

Let me give you some context ☝️

At my CS college, a friend came with an idea: He want to build pretty
mobile apps with [Kotlin lang][kotlin-website].

So I guided him with the following advice: _"Why don't you start
building simple things in the terminal and then implement it for
Android? Helps with looking for errors and logic."_

It was a bit obvious. So, give a try to simple projects, such as a
calculator, and then, send it to Android architecture, right? But
later I realized: Build a terminal calculator is extremely simple,
but I also don't know how 😨

So now, I'm on a mission: build a terminal calculator in Java (not
Kotlin, Java 🗿 \> Kotlin 🤓) with all basic math operations (add,
sub, mul, div, expo).
