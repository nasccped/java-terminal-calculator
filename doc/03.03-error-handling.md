03.03 | How to Implement (Error Handling)
=========================================

How can I implement bad expression evaluation?

There are a bunch of scenarios for this application, such as:

- **good expression:** `2 + 1`, returns a value as result;
- **bad expression:** `2 / 0`, returns an error value as result;
- **invalid expression:** `someword + 34`, returns evaluation
  syntax error as result;
- **good action call:** `!QUIT` or any other valid command name to
  call an program action;
- **bad action call:** `!22@UNDEFINEDCOMMD`, will raise an action
  call error.

So... how can I catch good and bad expressions, good and bad action
calls, valid and invalid input, process these same inputs and print
the final result in a fancy way at the terminal?

Let's think about it üí≠

Catch the input
---------------

When using a scientific calculator, we can proceed with
`division by 0` _(even with Err solution)_. There's an obvious
reason: **Calculators can't evaluate expressions at 'runtime'**, but
after return catching, we get an `Err` result. I was thinking about
something similar. I  can't figure out if the user is typing valid
expressions, only digits or if it's a valid action call _(and theres
the reason for getting String as input instead of Integer or
Double)_. So basically ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è I need to get all the given input as
String, check if it's a valid input, then, evaluate the result (if
it's possible, else return an error message).
