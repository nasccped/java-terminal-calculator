Java Terminal Calculator ðŸ§®
==========================

This project aims to help a friend in a side project and work on
knowledge in software structuring + OOP.

Project Requirements
--------------------

To run this project, you'll need:

1. **Git:** you will need some kind of VCS
   _(Version Control System)_. I strongly recomend
   [Git][git-website].
2. **OpenJDK:** you will need the official _Java tools_ collection
   that can be found at the [Oracle website][oracle-website].
3. **Make:** Instead of using a specific IDE for Java, this program
   was developed in an external IDE. To avoid compiling all the files
   manually you can use the Makefile present in the root directory.
   Just have [GNU Make][gnu-make-website] installed on your machine.
