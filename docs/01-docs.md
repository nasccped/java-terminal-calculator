01 | `docs` - How to read
=========================

This project isn't an API/library or something else. It's just a
program, so what's the `docs`?

When trying to do a different kind of program, I though:

> I've never tried this before. I can document all my journey to help

And here it is!

## How to read the docs?

The documentation is organized by the following schema:

```txt
+ root
+---+ docs (directory)
|   +--- AA-BBBB.md
|   +--- XX-YYYY.md
|   +--- (...)
+---- (...)
```

- `AA` and `XX` will always be numeric (`00`, `01`, `..`). It means
  the doc file order (probably chronological);
- `BBBB` and `YYYY` will always be alphanumeric (`TREE-ORGANIZE`,
  `EXPRESSION-EVALUATING`, `....`). It means the doc file
  meaning / subject covered.

> You can read the entire documentation. You can skip to the part
> that interests you. They both work well!
