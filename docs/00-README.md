===========

Welcome to the **java-terminal-calculator** documentation!

Here, I'll explain a lil bit about this project, my purposes and
possible challenges.

## What is that?

Simple! As the title and description says, it is a calculator program
app designed to be runned in the terminal.

## Why am I doing this?

A few months ago _(2024, October)_, my CS college friend has decided
to build a mobile calculator in **Kotlin** with Android Studio, but
there's a problem: **He didn't know how**!

As his friend, I encouraged him with the challenge. I said to start
with a simple idea:

- build the main logic on terminal;
- refactor until looks good (code structure);
- then, handle it with a good UI for mobile.

And then, he asked me to try to develop an alternative version for
the terminal. I accepted the challenge!

## What is the `docs`? What is the `00-README`?

This project isn't an API/library or something else. It's just a
program, so what's the `docs`?

When trying to do a different kind of program, I though:

> I've never tried this before. I can document all my journey to help
> others!

And here it is!
